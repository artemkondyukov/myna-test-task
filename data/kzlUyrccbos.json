I had lunch with JB Straubel and Hal Rosen and It was that it's like fish restaurant in El Segundo And Hal Rosen had been involved in space and electric vehicles and And jb was had just got just graduated from college was working with him and the conversation turned to electric vehicles Because Howard had done something called Rosen Motors, which was like an attempted evie startup, and I said well I've always been super interested in electric vehicles. I was gonna do my PhD on an advanced and reduced energy storage I Was gonna do grad studies on on advanced energy storage techniques for electric vehicles and And so JB said well have you heard of this company called AC propulsion because they had created It the t zero electric sports car as a prototype I was like wow that's great like lithium-ion batteries had really achieved a level of energy density that For the first time could allow you to have significant range in an electric car And they had a sports car that had zero to 60 in under four seconds at 250 mile range And it's pretty cool, and that was just made of it's just a kit car so it didn't have a roof or airbags or Thermal control system, and it was extremely unreliable it wasn't productized, but it was a proof of concept So I got the test drive from AC repulsion and I was like wow You guys should really commercialize this this would show people what electric cars can do and I tried for months to get AC propulsion to Go into production with the T 0 and Like they just were not interested in doing that "}, {"segment": {"start": 4003.55328125, "end": 4041.31109375}, "track": "QD", "label": "E", "text": "Amazingly they wanted to do an electric Scion, you know like that boxy car But the problem is like the electric saundra could cost $70,000 or You could build a sports car for $100,000. Okay, but like nobody's gonna buy the electric silent But fuel might fight electric sports car So After hounding them for months. I finally said like look if you guys are not going to Commercialize the T zero, would you mind if if I did that? They said no no problem. Go ahead. It's like great So I'm gonna do that with JV, and I said, but if you're if you're gonna do "}, {"segment": {"start": 4041.31109375, "end": 4054.54109375}, "track": "FW", "label": "B", "text": "If you're gonna go and try to productize t zero there's some other teams you should talk to that also interested in doing that So that's where Whatever hard macht hopping and Ian Wright came in "}, {"segment": {"start": 4054.54109375, "end": 4068.30265625}, "track": "QE", "label": "E", "text": "and No, I think that was probably the biggest mistake of my career quite frankly I "}, {"segment": {"start": 4068.30265625, "end": 4098.905468749999}, "track": "FX", "label": "B", "text": "The I I think whatever you think you can have your cake and eat it, too That's something you're probably wrong So I thought I can keep running SpaceX I'll dedicate 20% of my time to Tesla and that'll be fine but actually It didn't things really melted down Went through hell we're to recapitalize the company the Kimmel was there singing time "}, {"segment": {"start": 4098.905468749999, "end": 4109.44221875}, "track": "QF", "label": "E", "text": "So Silicon Valley accurate or not accurate that's the show yeah The it starts to get very accurate around around Episode four "}, {"segment": {"start": 4109.44221875, "end": 4109.99234375}, "track": "FY", "label": "B", "text": ""}, {"segment": {"start": 4111.0115937499995, "end": 4143.26478125}, "track": "QG", "label": "E", "text": "So took a few episodes to kind of get get grounded the first few episodes struck me as Hollywood making fun of Hollywood's idea of Silicon Valley which is like not you know not on point But then by about but the fourth or fifth episode season one it really starts get good and then by season two it's amazing in fact reality But the truth is stranger than fiction all the crazy stuff you see in that show Silicon Valley the reality is way crazier than that "}, {"segment": {"start": 4143.26478125, "end": 4155.71684375}, "track": "IV", "label": "C", "text": "Yeah, you've seen the two right yeah, I'm just like wow What will have to be a story for another time for says?
