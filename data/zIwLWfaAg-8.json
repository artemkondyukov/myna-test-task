So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,\nthat's on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\nand exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be able\nto operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much?

To give you an example,\nthe LA subway extension, which is -- I think it's\na two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed\nfor two billion dollars. So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile\nto do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\nutility subway in the world. So yeah, it's quite difficult\nto dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have\nat least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately\nan order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\nis to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\naccording to regulations has to be 26 feet,\nmaybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\nand emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\nfor combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\nto what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\nto get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\nby a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\nwith the cross-sectional area. So that's roughly a half-order\nof magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\nfor half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\nis putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\ntunneling and reinforcing, that will give you\na factor of two improvement. Combine that and that's a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being\nat their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\nto the machine substantially. I think you can get\nat least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five\nimprovement on top of that. So I think there's a fairly\nstraightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess\nof an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we've got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\nfrom \"South Park,\" I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" (Laughter) "}, {"segment": {"start": 331.37778125, "end": 332.07134375}, "track": "M", "label": "A", "text": ""}, {"segment": {"start": 332.07134375, "end": 343.49065625000003}, "track": "CU", "label": "B", "text": "So Gary is capable of -- currently he's capable\nof going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine.

It's like a branching\nstream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take\nthat affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing\nor slow down another thing. I may introduce something new\nto the probability stream. Sustainable energy\nwill happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\nif Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It's tautological. If you don't have sustainable energy,\nit means you have unsustainable energy. Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics\nwill drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value\nof a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\nthe advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good\nof a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\npotentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That's what I consider to be the fundamental\naspirational good of Tesla. Then there's becoming a multiplanet\nspecies and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable. It's very important to appreciate\nthis is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future\nI think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization\nis definitely not inevitable.
